# About this repo
This repository contains many programming projects that I made to learn
some programming languages, concepts, teqhniques, libraries, etc.

I don't think that the code written here will be perfect or follow best practices,
but I hope that it can be useful for someone who wants to learn or improve

I don't consider myself an expert in any of the topics covered here, so feel free to
point out any mistakes or suggest improvements.

# Ideas?
If you have any ideas for new projects or topics that you would like me to cover,
please open an issue.
