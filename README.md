# About this repo
This repository contains many programming projects that I made to learn
some programming languages, concepts, teqhniques, libraries, etc.

I don't think that the code written here will be perfect or follow best practices,
but I hope that it can be useful for someone who wants to learn or improve

I don't consider myself an expert in any of the topics covered here, so feel free to
point out any mistakes or suggest improvements.

# Probably good to know
You'll probably need cmake to build some of the projects here, as well as
python for some others.
List of the languages used in this repo (before writting any project xd) (probably
skipped some and never used others):
* C++
* Rust
* Python
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* C
* C#
* Java <- Probably only for Minecraft plugins and mods xd
* Go
* Lua
* ...

libraries that I'll probably use that you might need to install:
* SDL3 (SDL3_ttf)
* GLEW
* glm
* ImGui
* ...

I'll be updating this lists from time to time.

# Contributing
I don't think that I'll accept contributions to this repo, as I want to keep it
as my personal learning space. However, if you find any mistakes or have any suggestions,
feel free to open an issue. :)

# Ideas?
If you have any ideas for new projects or topics that you would like me to cover,
please open an issue.
